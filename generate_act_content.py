(2) **Potential Risks:** Without adequate safeguards, some program activities could result in localized environmental impacts that disproportionately affect minority and low-income communities;

(3) **Mitigation Measures:** The Program Office shall implement the following environmental justice safeguards: (a) mandatory Environmental Justice Plans for all projects; (b) enhanced public participation requirements for projects in environmental justice communities; (c) additional funding for projects that benefit environmental justice communities; and (d) regular monitoring and reporting of environmental justice outcomes.
